    <p> The game we created was Mole Mash.<br> In the game you are supposed to tap <br> on as many moles as you can to increase <br> your score within 45 seconds. After a <br> certain score is reached the game becomes <br> harder as more moles spawn and they
        change <br> holes faster. This game works on Android <br> and can be accessed with MIT App Inventor 2</p>
